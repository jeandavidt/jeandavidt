# Well, hello there! 👋🏻

I’m Jean-David, I work as a researcher at  Université Laval’s @[model*EAU*](https://github.com/modelEAU) group. We work on water quality modelling , which leads us to do things like [running a full-scale pilot wastewater treatment plant called pil*EAU*te](https://modeleau.fsg.ulaval.ca/news/?L=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=238&cHash=6090152d24588d3a797a08078ce96ba9) and [creating a data model to collect, store and contextualize water quality data (dat*EAU*base)](https://modeleau.fsg.ulaval.ca/projects/?no_cache=1&L=1&tx_fsgprofs_pi2[mode]=describe&tx_fsgprofs_pi2[projid]=27).

Sometimes, having friendly interfaces between the hard data and the people using it can make the actual science much smoother and way more fun.

While working with the group, I’ve developed:
* A [python toolkit](https://github.com/jeandavidt/rodtox_data_analysis) to collect, process and analyze sensor data coming from a RODTOX device (an organic matter analyser for wastewater plants).
* [Plotly-dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) web apps to [access, extract and clean up wastewater data from the our pilot plant’s database and SCADA](https://github.com/modelEAU/dateau_filtering), and to [see the plant’s performance in real-time](https://github.com/modelEAU/pileaute_dash).
* [Automatic reporting and visualization tools](https://github.com/modelEAU/AvN) for testing the efficacy of wastewater treatment strategies using live sensor data (AvN project).

Recently I’ve been excited to contribute to the Canada-wide effort to track SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater by contributing to [Big-Life-Lab’s Ottawa Data Model for wastewater-based epidemiology](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/covid-19-wastewater) and [developing visualization and data parsing tools](https://github.com/jeandavidt/ODM-Import/) that support this model.

Thanks for stopping by! 🤜🏻🤛🏽
